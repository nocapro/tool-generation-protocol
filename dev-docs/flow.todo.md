make sure to follow 5 test rules while also doing fixes without bandaids fake fixing... should has architectural paradigm 

===

lets implement e2e.test-plan.md to test/e2e/

=== DONE

create e2e.test-plan.md, integration.test-plan.md, unit.test-plan.md plan based on readme.md

well, I want it to be more comprehensive especially the e2e. 

also test rule codebase should be;

1. no mock, no spy
2. all real implementation to verify implementation
3. isolated
4. idempotent
5. clean even on sigterm

=== DONE

spot any unimplemented, todo, stub, placeholder etc... we need production ready codebase

analyse codebase to spot mock, unimplemented, todo, stub, placeholders.. because I want production ready

=== DONE

Lets achieve readme.md requirements compliance

Lets achieve readme.md requirements and expectations compliance and production ready codebase

=== DONE

lets bring readme.md into production ready manifestation by developing codebase. I want HOFs, no OOP or classes, no casting as any or unknown. all should follows readme.md requirements

===

give me diff patches fixing readme.md to achieve the goals and phylosohpy by eliminating inconsistencies

===

is tgp serverless friendly like cloudflare? as it rely on git so should leverege github where auto pull push right? why not asking github creds in the config

===

make the agent produce code quality:
1. abstract
2. composable
3. HOFs
4. stateless
5. reusable
6. general by params
7. no hardcoded values
8. can also orchesstrate or import from existing functions

also the agent need to has certain tools and capabilities like list_files, read, write, search_replace, etc
